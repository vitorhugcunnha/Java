# Java Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Java**.   

---

## üéØ Purpose

- To start building a strong foundation in **Java programming**.  
- To prepare myself for future opportunities in **software development**, since Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages.  
- To eventually work on **larger projects** where Java is commonly applied (enterprise applications, backend services, Android apps, etc.).  

---

## üìö Why Java?

- Java is a **powerful, object-oriented language** with a massive ecosystem.  
- It is widely used in **enterprise systems, APIs, web servers, and Android development**.  
- Learning Java is an excellent way to understand **software engineering principles** and prepare for real-world projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Java Code

### Option 1: Using the JDK
1. Install the latest **JDK** ([Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)).  
2. Save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`.  
3. Open a terminal in the folder containing the file.  
4. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
Run the program:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
java HelloWorld
Option 2: Using an IDE (Easier for Beginners)
You can also use an IDE that already includes Java support:

IntelliJ IDEA

Eclipse

NetBeans

Or even Dev-C++ (with Java setup) if you prefer a simpler environment.

An IDE allows you to write, compile, and run your Java code with a single click.

üìÇ Current Repository Content
HelloWorld.java ‚Üí First program in Java, printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.

java
Copiar c√≥digo
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
üöÄ Future Goals
Add more basic exercises (loops, arrays, functions, OOP).

Build small projects (calculators, games, utilities).

Learn Java frameworks such as Spring Boot for backend development.

Explore Android development with Java.
